# Images
In this project I used several images to create visual that could stand by the message of sustainibility. They can be seen here:

I found the modification of these images through layers to be extremely frustrating at times, mostly because I couldn't select "wrap text" like in word.
Probably the most complicating to use was the scaling tool because if a new layer was added on top of the background layer, it wanted to completely remove the background when it was adjusted.
I looked up several tutorials, but could not seem to find the answer, so unfortunately I felt limited by this difficulty.
Despite these setbacks, though, I think I have successfully mastered the use of images in some ways.
